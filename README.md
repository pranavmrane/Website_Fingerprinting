# Core Idea

The objective of this project is to demonstrate Browser Fingerprinting. Browser Fingerprinting allows web services to track your interaction on a website.

The most recent interactions can be tied back to previous interactions. All of this can be done without login information or cookies.

## Pre-Requisites

The process needs npm, node and react installed on the machine

The project files must also be cloned in a folder

## Run Instructions

### Start Backend

Backend can be started by nativating to {root_folder_address}/backend/
Then backend server can be started by typing `nodemon server`

### Start Frontend

Backend can be started by nativating out to {root_folder_address}/
Then frontend server can be started by typing `npm start`

## Using the tool

Once the tool in started, type a number in text box

This number will be saved on the backend server
If the tool has been used previously then all previous entries will be also be fetched
